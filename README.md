# About JPSCO5890

----

- I am currently working on computational tools for biology, like AHA (auto homology-appending) which will be used for quick Gibson-assembly primer construction.
- I am interested in the combination of '*classical*', wet-lab biology and computational biology for the betterment of conducting experiments and asking biological questions!
- You can contact me at jpsco5890-github_questions@pm.me with any questions, comments, jokes, or fun-facts.
